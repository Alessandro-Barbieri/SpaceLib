What is SPACELIBÂ©?
SPACELIB is a software library useful 
for the realization of programs for the kinematic and dynamic 
analysis of systems of rigid bodies. 
This library is currently used in ROBOTICS and BIOMECHANICS. 
It has been developed at the Mechanical Engineering Department 
of the University of Brescia.

Three versions of the library are currently available:

	* c language (numerical computetion)
	* matlab     (numerical computation)
	* MAPLEV     (symbolic manipulation)


The library is offered with:

	* full source code
	* a full reference manual
	* commented application examples
	* papers describing the mathematic theory which 
          is at the base of spacelib

The functions contained in the library are devoted to:

* basis operations on matrices 
    sum, product, (pseudo)inversion, ...
* basic operation on points, lines and planes
    line between two points
    plane defined by three points
    intersection / projection of point, lines on planes
    ...
* basic operation on vectors
    module, dot product, cross product, ...
* tranformation matrices (rototranslations)
* velocity and acceleration matrices
* Cardan/Euler angles
    tranformation of angles to/from rotation matrices
    derivative of angles to/from angular velocity and acceleration
* linear systems

The library is intended as an aid in writing programs for the 
analysis of systems of rigid bodies following a particular 
methodology based on 4*4 matrices. This approach can be 
considered a powerful generalization of the Transformation 
Matrix Approach  proposed by Denavit and Hartenberg.
Shortly the position and the orientation of each body is 
represented by 4*4 transformation matrices.
Two others matrices called W and H are utilized for the velocity 
and the acceleration (linear and angular).
Additional matrices are used for the momentum, forces, torques, 
inertia.

The main feature of this methodology is that it allows the 
development of the analysis of systems of rigid bodies in a 
systematic way simplifying the symbolic manipulation of equations 
as well as the realization of efficient numerical programs.
